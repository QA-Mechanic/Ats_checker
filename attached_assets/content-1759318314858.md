## FAQs

How do I know if my resume is ATS-compliant?

Each Applicant Tracking System has different methods of scanning and filtering resumes. A resume scanner will be able to detect [formatting errors](https://www.jobscan.co/blog/ats-formatting-mistakes/) that make your resume hard to understand for different Applicant Tracking Systems. Jobscan’s resume scanner will give you a match rate based on top ATS including [iCIMS](https://www.jobscan.co/blog/icims-ats/), [Recruiterbox](https://www.jobscan.co/blog/heres-what-job-seekers-should-know-about-the-recruiterbox-ats/) [Lever](https://www.jobscan.co/blog/lever-ats/), [Greenhouse](https://www.jobscan.co/blog/greenhouse-ats-what-job-seekers-need-to-know/) and [Taleo](https://www.jobscan.co/blog/taleo-popular-ats-ranks-job-applications/).

What is a good ATS score for a resume?

We recommend a match rate score of 75%. However, many career counselors and Jobscan users see success even with just a 65% match rate.

There is such a thing as an over-optimized resume. The general rule is that a higher score is better, but it might not be possible to score above 75% without overstuffing your resume with keywords.

Do ATS scan resumes?

Each system offers a different combination and scope of features, but ATS are primarily used to help hiring companies collect, organize, and filter applicants. That means that an ATS will scan your resume and search for certain keywords, skills, job titles, and education that the recruiter is looking for.

Job seekers who submit their resume and job application through an online form are interacting with an ATS.

Can ATS detect PDF?

[Our tests have shown](https://www.jobscan.co/blog/resume-pdf-vs-word/#best-file-format-ats) that some applicant tracking systems more accurately parse .docx resumes. For this reason, we recommend uploading your resume in the .docx (Microsoft Word) format when applying to a job, unless the job posting requests a PDF.

What Is a Resume Checker?

A resume checker will scan your resume and compare it to a job description. The checker will show you if your resume is optimized for an ATS and for the job listing. To ensure that the resume is optimized for an ATS, the resume checker will check the [formatting](https://www.jobscan.co/blog/ats-formatting-mistakes/) and [file type](https://www.jobscan.co/blog/resume-pdf-vs-word/#best-file-format-ats). It will compare the text in the resume to see if it matches the skills, keywords, job titles, and education requirements mentioned in the job listing.

How to make an ATS-friendly resume

Here are some quick tips on [how to beat applicant tracking systems](https://www.jobscan.co/blog/ats-resume/):

- Tailor your resume to the specific job you are applying for.
- Match your resume keywords to skills found in the job description.
- Use long-form and acronym versions of keywords.
- Use Chronological or Hybrid resume format.
- Don’t use tables, columns, or graphics.
- Use a screen-friendly, traditional font.
- Don’t use headers or footers.
- Use standard resume section headings.
- Save Your File as a .docx if possible

How does Jobscan work?

Jobscan improves job placement by helping job seekers land 3X more interviews and cutting job search time in half.

**Here’s the process:** Upload your resume and copy-and-paste a job listing you’re applying for. Jobscan will analyze your resume for formatting errors, key qualifications, hard skills, best practices, word count, tone, and more. View your match rate to see how closely your resume matches the job you’re applying for. Then, optimize your resume with personalized suggestions based on the job description you entered. As you make changes, you’ll see your match rate improve!

Use Jobscan for every job application to increase your chances of getting a job interview.

Jobscan also features a potent lineup of other job search tools, such as the free resume builder, Power Edit real-time resume editor, and LinkedIn Optimization.

What is an ATS?

An [applicant tracking system (ATS)](https://www.jobscan.co/applicant-tracking-systems) is a human resources software that acts as a database for job applicants. ATS are used by companies of all sizes to organize, search, and communicate with large groups of applicants. Ninety-nine percent of Fortune 500 companies use an ATS as part of their recruiting strategy.

Why do you need a resume checker?

With the limitations and drawbacks of the ATS, there is a risk that you can be filtered out if your resume is not written and formatted with the ATS in mind. To increase your chances of getting past the ATS and getting your resume read by a real person, you need to optimize your resume and make sure that it is [compatible with the ATS](https://www.jobscan.co/blog/20-ats-friendly-resume-templates/).

What exactly is being checked? Can you rate my resume?

Jobscan's resume scanner analyzes your resume against proven recruiter preferences and hidden requirements buried in the job description. It compares hard skills, soft skills, and industry buzzwords from the job listing to your resume.

When your resume is scanned, you're given a match rate. Your match rate is based on these four priorities, in order:

- Hard skills
- Education level (only when an advanced degree is included in the job description)
- Job title
- Soft skills
- Other keywords

Resume word count and measurable results are not factored into the match rate.

When signed in, it is located in the drop-down menu at the top right and allows you to provide Jobscan with information including your industry and where you are in the job search process. With a complete profile, Jobscan’s suggestions become more targeted to you personally when your profile is complete.
